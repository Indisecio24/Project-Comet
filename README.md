This is Project Comet, my first proper attempt at making a game with PyGame.
It is going to be a platformer with some action elements.

Here is the big checklist: (*italics* is incomplete or not started)
- Tiles (Rendering, Loading, Autotiling)
- Collisions (Sprite-Tile, *Sprite-Sprite*)
- Event Handler (Runtime, Pause, *Menu*)
- Camera (Follow, Static, Render)
- *Pause Menu* (*Menu Elements*, *Input*)
- *Deltatime* (*Movement*, *Animation*)
- *Main Menu* (*Menu*, *Input*, *Graphics*)
- *Base Class for Entities* (*Textures*, *State Machine*)
- *Player* (*Inheritance*, *Movement*, *States*)
- *Debug Menu* (*Menu Overlay*, *Hotkey Toggle*)
- *Settings (*Menu*, *Volume*, *Window Size & Game Resolution*, *Accessibility*)
- *Collectibles* (*Inheritance*, *States*)
- *Enemies* (*Inheritance*, *States*)
- *Editor* (*Menu*, *Hotkey Toggle*, *Saving Levels*, *Controls*)

I am slowly going through the big checklist, going back when I can improve on previous features.
This is the second version of the project as the first version was broken beyond fixing.
Let's hope this one doesn't break!
